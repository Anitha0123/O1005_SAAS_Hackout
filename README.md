AIM: - 
To shed light on this issue and contribute to the broader conversation on mental health and suicide prevention. My project is not just about analysing data; it's about sparking change, increasing awareness, and saving lives."

GOAL: - 
Identify Patterns and Causes: To uncover patterns and potential causes of suicide among men. This can help us better understand the underlying factors, such as economic, social, or psychological, that contribute to higher suicide rates in this demographic.
Raise Awareness: The more we know about the issue, the better equipped we are to raise awareness. I plan to create data visualizations and insights that can be shared with the public, policymakers, and mental health organizations to promote awareness and action.
Inform Interventions: Ultimately, I want to use the insights gained from the data to inform potential interventions and policies that can reduce suicide rates among men. This may involve proposing targeted mental health support programs, suicide prevention strategies, or initiatives to reduce stigma around men seeking help.

WHY: - (I chose the dataset on men's suicide for several reasons) 
•	It addresses an urgent and often under-discussed issue
•	It's an important and pressing social issue that often goes overlooked. 
•	Men's mental health is a topic that hasn't received as much attention as it should, and
• Suicide rates among men are alarmingly high in many parts of the world.
